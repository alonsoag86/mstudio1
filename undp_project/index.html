    <div class="title"> Access to Electricity, Clean Cooking Technologies and Under Five Mortality Rate in Africa </div>
    <div class="content" id="intro">According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/gho/child_health/mortality/mortality_under_five_text/en/">WHO</a>, 
    Africa remains the region were the risk of dying before completing five years of age remains the highest in the world. 
    The continent is home to five of the six countries with an under five mortality rate <span>above 100 deaths per 1000 live births</span>.
    As part of the SDG agenda, the <a href="https://www.who.int/sdg/targets/en/">UN</a> has set the goal of reducing the
    under five mortality rate to at least as low as 25 per 1000 live births. The following project explores the relationship 
    between access to electricity, clean cooking technologies, under five morality rate in Africa and how have they have changed over time.
    As a final element we take a closer look at Nigeria in order to evaluate some of the consequences of having unequal access to electricity
    and clean cooking technologies at a more granular level.

        Access to electricity can significantly improve the wellbeing of the population. Counting on reliable sources of energy 
        can act as a critical enabler for the delivery of health services as it enhances the conditions of hospitals and clinics throughout the Continent. Trustworthy electricity systems secure better lighting 
        conditions in emergency care rooms, small clinics can keep the vaccines and medicines refrigerated, hospitals can perform studies that require scans without any interruptions. 
        In the households, electricity can help preserve the food, heat the water and expand the food preparation process. This actions can reduce the risk of getting infected.

    <div class="message" class="content">
        Improving access to clean cooking technologies in Africa is one of the most important goals of the continent. 
        Unreliable power supplies prompt families to increase the usage of indoor fires and kerosene lamps causing indoor 
        pollution in many households across the Continent. Relying on these technologies heavily increase the probability of 
        contracting acute lower respiratory infections. Children under five are the most vulnerable group of the population that gets 
        constantly exposed to the risks of using  inefficient and dangerous fuels. The problem is particularly grave in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
        where, according to a recent report elaborated by the <a href=" http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRREGTOPENERGY/Resources/WorldBank_ACCES_AFREA_AFTEG_ESMAP_FINAL.pdf">World Bank</a>, 
        over 82% of the population (~700 million people) remains dependent on solid fuels such as charcoal, dung, fuelwood, and other biomass for cooking purposes.
